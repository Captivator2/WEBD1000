# Guided Workshop: Planning Your Website – Content Inventory & Sitemap

## Why This Matters

Before writing any code, you need a plan. A website is like a building:

* The **content inventory** is your list of materials.
* The **sitemap** is your blueprint for how everything fits together.

This exercise will guide you through creating both.

## Step 1: Define Your Website Idea

**Task:** Choose a website idea that matters to you. Examples:

* A **portfolio site** to showcase your projects
* A **club or community site** for events and updates
* A **small business site** for services or products

    👉 Write your idea below (2–3 sentences):

    * What is the purpose of your site?
    * Who is your main audience?
    * What should visitors be able to do?

**My Website Idea:**
What is the purpose of your site?
 The purpose of my site is to share information about my club. I want to give people updates, event details, and a way to connect.

Who is your main audience?
My main audience is students who are interested in joining or learning about the club. For people that wants clear, quick access to club news and events.

What should visitors be able to do?
Visitors should be able to read about the club and see upcoming events. They should also be able to contact the club easily.

## Step 2: Create a Content Inventory

Your content inventory is a list of everything your site will include.

### How to do it:

1. **List your pages**: Start with *Home, About, Contact*. Add more as needed (e.g., Projects, Blog, Services).
2. **Add content items** under each page: text, images, forms, videos, etc.
3. **Mark priority**: High = must have, Medium = nice to have, Low = optional.

### Example (Portfolio Site):

| Page/Section | Content Item          | Type  | Source           | Priority | Notes               |
| ------------ | --------------------- | ----- | ---------------- | -------- | ------------------- |
| Homepage     | Welcome message       | Text  | Write myself     | High     | Keep to 2 sentences |
| Homepage     | Headshot photo        | Image | Personal photo   | High     | Crop and resize     |
| About        | Short bio             | Text  | Write myself     | High     | Use plain language  |
| Projects     | Screenshot of project | Image | From GitHub repo | High     | Must be compressed  |

### Now You Try:

Fill in your own **Content Inventory Table** below.

| Page/Section | Content Item           | Type (Text,Image,Video,Form)| Source (Where from?) | Priority (High/Med/Low) | Notes           |
| ------------ | ------------           | ----------------------------| -------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------  |
| Homepage     | Welcome message        |  Text                       |  Write myself        |   High                  |  2 sentences    |
| Homepage     | Club photo/logo        |  Image                      |  Take a photo        |   High                  | if its too big,place at top                     |
| About        | What the club is about |  Text                       |  Write myself        |   High                  | 4 sentences to  |
| Events       | list of upcoming events|  Text                       |  Write myself        |   High                  | Update oten with date,time and location         |
| Events       | Event photos           | Images                      | From past events     | Medium                  | Add later if theres space and compress if large |
| Contact      | Email or Form          |  Text/Form                  |  Club email          |   High                  | Simple email link                               |
*(Add more rows as needed.)*

## Step 3: Draw Your Sitemap

A sitemap shows how your pages connect.

### Rules of Thumb:

* Keep **5–7 items** in your top navigation.
* Group related pages (e.g., “About → Team”).
* Labels should be **clear and consistent** (don’t mix “About Me” and “Who I Am”).

### Example (Portfolio Site):

```
Home
 ├── About
 ├── Projects
 │     ├── Project 1
 │     ├── Project 2
 ├── Blog
 └── Contact
```

### Your Turn:

👉 Use **boxes for pages** and **arrows for links**.
Options:

* Draw on paper and take a photo.
* Use a free tool: draw\.io, Lucidchart, or Miro.

**Sketch Space:**

```
[ draw your sitemap here ]
```
Home
 ├── About
 ├── Events
 │     └── Event photos (optional)
 └── Contact

## Step 4: Reflect

Answer these reflection prompts in 3–4 sentences:

1. How did your target audience shape your sitemap?
2. Was any part of your site hard to organize? Why?
3. How will you make sure your site structure supports accessibility?

**My Reflection:**

```
My target audience is students who want quick access to club information, so I kept the sitemap simple with only four main pages: Home, About, Events, and Contact. The hardest part was deciding whether to include more sections, but I chose to keep it small so visitors don’t get lost. To support accessibility, I will use clear labels, add alt text to images, and make sure the navigation is easy to follow. This way, anyone can understand and use the site.
```
