1.How does semantic HTML improve accessibility for Corah’s senior users?

Semantic HTML improves accessibility for Chelsea Club fans, especially older users
because it helps screen readers and browsers understand the structure of the page.
This makes navigation and reading easier for everyone.

2.Which semantic elements were easiest or hardest to implement? Why?

The easiest elements to use were header and footer because they fit easily into the top and bottom of the page. 
The hardest was section and article because I wasn’t sure which one to use, 
but I learned that article is for single pieces like event posts.
 
3.How does this structure support CSS styling in future weeks?

This structure will make adding CSS easier later because everything already has a clear section.
It will help me style each part of the website without confusion.
