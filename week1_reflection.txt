Setting up my tools was both easy and challenging in different ways. 
Creating a GitHub account and making a repository was straightforward, but learning the Git commands to clone, add, commit, and push took a little practice.
 I realized that paying attention to the exact commands and file locations is very important. 
 Writing pseudocode and flowcharts helped me think through the steps of a program before actually coding it. 
One new thing I learned today was how to use diagrams.net to create flowcharts, which will be useful for planning programs in the future.
