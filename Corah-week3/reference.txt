Reference Website: Spencer House Seniors Centre

Good things:

Clear mission and description right at top, so visitors know what the site is about immediately 

They list services and events, for example: activities, hot meals and internet access

Website mentions accessible building and accessible washroom which shows concern for users with mobility issues 

Bad things:

Some text is small and a bit hard to read for older users.

There isn’t much color contrast, which can make reading harder.

Not all images seem to have alt text for accessibility.


i recommend:
Use larger, bold fonts for the main content to ensure readability.

Make sure every image has alt="…” descriptive text.
