| Criteria                               | Findings / Examples                                                                                                  | Recommendations                                                               |

| Navigation & Menu Structure            | The website has a simple top menu with links to programs, contact info, and events. It’s easy to find pages.         | Keep the menu layout, but make the text bigger for seniors.                   |
| Text Readability (contrast, font size) | Font size is okay but could be a bit bigger for older users. The contrast between text and background is mostly good.| Increase font size slightly and use darker text for better readability.       |
| Alt Text & Images                      | Some images don’t have alt text                                                                                      | Add descriptive alt text for every image so screen readers can describe them. |
| Forms & Interactive Elements           | There aren’t many forms, but the contact section is simple and works.                                                | Make sure all form labels are clear and easy to tab through with a keyboard.  |
| Mobile Responsiveness                  | The website adjusts to mobile screens but some images shrink too much.                                               | Test the mobile version and make buttons larger for easy tapping.             |

Step 3
Seniors will naviagte he site easily because it will have clear menus, large buttons and simple words.Each page will have the same layout so they always know where things are.
The most important things for them are events, contact info and abput the community.
The homepage should have a big welcome message and a picture that feels friendly. It should also show the next events right away.
